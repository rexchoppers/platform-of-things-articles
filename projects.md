# Projects

As humans, sometimes it's hard to see the bigger picture. We get caught up in the day-to-day and forget to look at the bigger picture. This page is a collection of projects I've worked on over the years. Some are big, small, open-source, employer projects, and some are just for fun.

Usually a lot of developers wouldn't bother to document their projects, but as I've got a range of experience across many languages/frameworks/integrations, I thought it would be a good idea to document them. This page is a living document and will be updated as I work on more projects.

If you're interested in any of the projects, feel free to reach out to me
