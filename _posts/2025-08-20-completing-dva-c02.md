# Overview
I've had a fair few years with AWS now so I've been collecting certifications like they're Pokémon. DVA-C02 is another certification from AWS, this time focusing on everything development. 

# Preparation
Once again, I used the following Udemy courses to study for this certification:

# Exam
The exam itself was pretty straightforward—online and proctored. I got straight into my exam without any waiting or issues. 

The exam itself is:

- 65 questions to answer. 
- 140 minutes to complete.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Few curveball questions as you'd expect

The step up from foundational to associate level is noticeable, and the questions require a deeper understanding of the services and their use cases. The technical knowedge wasn't the issue but more how the questions are worded. There are answers in the listthat will catch you out.

# Conclusion
Roll on the next exam
