# Overview
I've gone to the dark side and whilst I used AI tools, I thought it was time to get certified. AIF-C01 is another certification from AWS, this time focusing on AI. The exam is designed for individuals who are looking to demonstrate their knowledge of AWS AI services.

# Preparation
Instead of using books, this time I've used the following Udemy courses:

[https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-ai-practitioner-certified](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-ai-practitioner-certified)
[https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-ai-practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-ai-practitioner)

I've recently inherited a 2020 iPad so using videos on the iPad was a lot easier than using my laptop.

[https://www.aws.training/](https://www.aws.training/) Also has a set of 20 offical exam questions that are free.

The courses cover a wide range of general AI topics and specific AWS services.

# Exam
The exam itself was pretty straightforward—online and proctored. Unlike CLF-C02, I got straight into my exam without any waiting or issues. 

The exam itself is:

- 65 questions to answer. 
- 100 minutes to complete.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Few curveball questions as you'd expect

I finished in around 40 minutes. This exam does not provide a pass/fail score straight away. This is given to you in an email a few hours/days later.

This exam was harder than CLF-C02. Even with vast amounts of preperation, the way the questions are worded can be tricky. Exam practice will be key to passing this exam and I would recommend doing as many practice exams as possible.

# Conclusion
If you're looking for an easy introduction into AI as a whole, this is a good exam to start from. It'll teach you a lot of basic concepts and give you a good understanding of the AWS AI services.

Roll on the next exam
