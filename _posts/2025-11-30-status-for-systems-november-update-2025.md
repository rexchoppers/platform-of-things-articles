title:  "Status For Systems - November Update (2025)"

# Overview
Originally, I built Status For Systems using a Flutter frontend and a NestJS backend, packaged together into a single container for deployment. The proof of concept went well, and I was happy with the progress — but the project quickly became a bit of a pain to maintain.

Status For Systems has been migrated to Next.js, keeping everything in one place, reducing the mental load — plus, I love React.

I’ll keep pushing this project forward as much as I can. There are plans to add metrics, notifications, and everything in between. It will remain open-source — I have no intention of commercialising it (Unless there's a SaaS demand of course)
